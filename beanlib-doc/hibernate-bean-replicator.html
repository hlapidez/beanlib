<h1>Beanlib - HibernateBeanReplicator </h1>
Replicate Hibernate objects with ease.
<p>
This class can be used to conveniently replicate Hibernate objects 
that follow the JavaBean getter/setter convention on a best attempt basis.
  
The replication is typically recursive in that 
the whole object graph of the input object is replicated into an equivalent output object graph, 
resolving circular references, and eagerly fetching proxied instances as necessary.

However, the exact behavior of the replication process including<ul>
<li>to what extent the input object graph should be traversed and/or replicated; and </li>
<li>whether proxied instances should be eagerly fetched or not</li>
</ul> 
can be controlled and/or supplemented by the client code via various options:
<p>
<ol>
<li>All the configurable options of {@link BeanPopulatorBaseSpi} are available, as
the replication of JavaBean properties inevitably involves bean population.</li>
<p>
<li>If the default property filter {@link HibernatePropertyFilter} is used,
<ul>
  <li>An application package prefix used to determine if a property 
      with a type of an entity bean class will be included for replication;</li>
  <li>The set of entity bean classes for matching properties that will be replicated;</li>
  <li>The set of collection and map properties that will be replicated;</li>
  <li>A {@link PropertyFilter vetoer} used to veto the propagation of a property</li>
</ul>
<p>
<li>For anything else that the existing implementation fails to transform, client can provide
one or multiple custom transformer factories via  
{@link #initCustomTransformerFactory(net.sf.beanlib.spi.CustomBeanTransformerSpi.Factory...)}.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Customizing HibernateBeanReplicator</h2>
Customizing the behavior of HibernateBeanReplicator is basically parallel to that of <a href="bean-replicator.html#customizing-behavior">BeanReplicator</a>,
except the custom transformer(s) needs to be provided via the initCustomTransformerFactory method instead of the constructor.
For example, assuming a <a href="bean-replicator.html#MyBeanTransformer">MyBeanTransformerFactory</a> is defined,
<pre><blockquote>// Partially overrides the default Hibernate bean transformer's behavior
HibernateBeanReplicator replicator = new Hibernate3BeanReplicator();
replicator.initCustomTransformerFactory(new MyBeanTransformerFactory());
replicator.copy(...);
