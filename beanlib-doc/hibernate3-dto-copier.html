<h1>Beanlib - Hibernate3DtoCopier</h1>
(This documentation is applicable to the Beanlib 5.x release.)
<p>
A simple facade of <a href="hibernate-bean-replicator.html">HibernateBeanReplicator</a>,
this class provides a simplified (but limited) API for the common use cases
to conveniently replicate Hibernate objects 
that follow the JavaBean getter/setter convention on a best attempt basis.
<p>
Those application specific Hibernate objects would typically
have the same package prefix.
<p>  
The replication is typically recursive in that 
the whole object graph of the input object is replicated into an equivalent output object graph, 
resolving circular references, and eagerly fetching proxied instances as necessary.

However, the exact behavior of the replication process can be controlled 
and/or supplemented by the client code via 3 main options:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Specifying an application package prefix: 
property with a type of an entity bean class with package name that matchs the prefix will be replicated;</li>
<li>Specifying a set of entity bean classes: property with a type of an entity bean class 
that is part of the set will be replicated;</li>
<li>Specifying a set of collection and map properties that will be replicated;</li>
</ul>
</ol>

For more advanced options and more control, 
consider using <a href="hibernate-bean-replicator.html">HibernateBeanReplicator</a> directly.
